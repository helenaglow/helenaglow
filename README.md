### Hello! My name is Helena 🌱

I am wrapping up my 4th year of CS at the University of Toronto. Currently, I am working on...
- **CSC486:** Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
- **STA304:** Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data
- Research with [CSSLab](https://csslab.cs.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto
- Social Media for the [_In the Loop_](https://dcs-utoronto-in-the-loop.simplecast.com/) podcast

Checkout my [personal website](https://helenaglow.github.io/) for a bit more about me! (_It might still be under construction_)
